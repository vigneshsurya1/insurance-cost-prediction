# Insurance Data Analysis Project

This project provides an in-depth analysis of insurance data using
Python. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA),
and visualization, making it a useful resource for data enthusiasts and
professionals working with insurance datasets.

## Features

-   **Data Loading:** Reads and preprocesses insurance datasets for
    analysis.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes key trends,
    distributions, and correlations in the data.
-   **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, outliers, and formats
    data appropriately.
-   **Visualization:** Provides insightful plots for understanding the
    dataset.
